# Welcome to My Libasm
***

## Task
The problem I have is that I have a basic knowledge of assembly language. 
and the problems in the project code were to eliminate the defects that arose during its use

## Description
I solved the problem by further developing the project              

## Installation
the project does not support use via make. it starts based on commands depending on what OS it is:
For LINUX os : nasm -felf64 file_name.asm && ld file_name.o && ./a.out
For MAC os : nasm -fmacho64 file_name.asm && ld file_name.o && ./a.out

## Usage
this project runs on command line on linux or mac os 

```
./my_project argument1 argument2
```
